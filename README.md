Horse Bank Forex

This app provides exchange rates . Users can get exchange rates by selecting a currency on the drop down box. 
Exchange rates are given against the USD. 
The App also provides a graph showing rates for the last 30 Days.

uses the MVVM architecture, Single Activity principle and Databinding.
also used Dagger for dependency injection. 
used the https://fxmarketapi.com/ API for the data.

Retrofit2 was used to access the API data. 
Helped me to load the data asynchronously therefore I did not have to use Work Manager.

I also wrote instrumented unit test using JUNIT 4 and Expresso.
